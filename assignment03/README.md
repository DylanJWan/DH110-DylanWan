# User Research 
#### Dylan Wan 

## Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project will help environmentally conscious individuals buy sustainable seafood, by giving them information on specific species’ impact, information if they are MSC or ASC certified, and where to buy those products. 

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? 
This project will help satisfy its users’ goals toward sustainable living. Sustainable use of ocean products on a large scale improves the quality of Earth’s water, a resource necessary for all living things to survive. Participating in this lifestyle may also improve the user’s self esteem needs, as they will leave feeling confident that they are doing their part to help the environment.


### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The most common current solutions I’ve found that people take when on a mission towards sustainable seafood consumption are to look up sustainable species on websites such as SeafoodWatch, wandering into grocery stores looking for certified sustainable labels, and buying from local markets. However, many do not know where exactly to buy these products nor are they aware of trustworthy sustainability labels.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
There is no site/app containing a synthesis of information about what, how, and where to get sustainable seafood. A lot of the sustainability websites are hard to navigate or do not have enough information to help a person with a plan to buy a specific sustainable seafood product. I aim to streamline the process of finding these products for users.

## Step02: Target users
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme)
This program will be primarily focussed on American consumers as other countries may not have the same sustainability regulations/labeling, possibly making the app/website not applicable in their area. Users must also have access to the internet to use the site because the information will constantly update depending on changes in seafood availability. User’s who can buy their own food are preferred as their usage of the site could directly pertain to their own eating habits.

### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Anyone living in or visiting the US can use the program if they are interested in purchasing seafood. There will be a location feature that can make the distance from products available to view. Because the program will be an app/website, the information provided will be available 24/7.

### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
User’s will need to input any one or all of the following information to the program: species of seafood, name of one of the sustainability labels, and current general location. The combination of these factors, depending on how many are used, will determine the effectiveness of finding sustainable seafood currently available to the user.

## Step03: Pick an qualitative research method
For this project I will be employing contextual inquiry in order to get user insight. The interview will consist of questions and observation through activities.

## Insights/Observations from interview

### 1. Participant says that eating sustainably boosts self esteem 
Speaker 1 3:53  
Why do you think eating sustainably is important?

Speaker 2  3:58  
Because I think that climate change is already like a problem. And it's only going to get worse. So it helps to ease my conscience to not eat as much meat products and I also thought it would be kind of a easy switch because I mostly eat fish anyway. 

### 2. Participant is more likely to notice bad/warning signs than signs indicating good
Speaker 1  6:00  
you know, or just sustainable? 

Speaker 2  6:01  
Oh, um, if like, I usually don't go to the dining halls that have the little red, or, like, I don't pick the meals that have a little red thing, which is like, it usually ends up being like the meat dishes anyways. So it's usually fine, but I usually try to pick the green ones.

### 3. Different preferences for view of sustainability info depending on if participant is viewing the product online vs in person 
Speaker 1  1:58  
So are you looking for an article that asks if it's sustainable? Are you looking at the little images to see if there's a sustainability label? What are you looking for first?

Speaker 2  2:12  
I guess I'm just looking for, like, like a, like a website link that like just tells me whether or not it's sustainable, which might be a little bit too much to ask for.

Speaker 1  2:26  
So you think text would be easier? Rather than a logo or label on the actual product? When you're searching?

Speaker 2  2:36  
I guess. If I'm looking at it online, then I would expect there to be text but like, if I'm looking at the actual packaging, I would expect like, like a logo.

### Eating sustainably may be difficult depending on region and socioeconomic status 
Speaker 1  7:18  
And what do you think? Do you think reducing the amount of meat in your diet and would be hard for other people who do who maybe don't live in LA or go to UCLA?

Speaker 2  7:33  
Yeah, I definitely think so. Um, especially because, like, culturally, I feel like, American food is pretty like meat based. And then, like, LA like, we have a lot of options, but a lot of places don't. And then UCLA does pretty good job. So yeah, I think it definitely very hard.

## Reflection
To my surprise, the aspect of the interview that was the most difficult to execute was the user research, rather than the user testing. I found it somewhat challenging to create compelling questions that would stimulate the subject’s thought process in a complex and productive manner. At certain moments during the interview, I felt that my script did not naturally fit the conversation, which led me to improvise some parts. Although this improvisation required quick thinking and pushed me to go off-script, it also enabled me to further expand my vision and organically develop my ideas. In addition, there were also questions I did not end up asking because the participant had already addressed them in previous sections before I prompted the questions. This was a contributing factor towards my need to improvise and thus presented unexpected challenges. However, the result was cohesive and I believe that the improvisation became more of an asset than an obstacle and assisted me in fully executing my project. 

While the subject was not an expert on the topic of seafood sustainability, she was still adept at using technology and navigating the necessary resources to aid in her search. However, the participant already had a background in sustainable eating, which allowed her to answer the questions pertaining to sustainability rather quickly. If I was to conduct this experiment again, I would change my approach by finding an additional subject that had no background knowledge on the topic of sustainable food or lifestyles. I would then compare their results to my current subjects to see if there are clear discrepancies between a subject with background knowledge versus a subject without. 

Overall, this research helped me uncover the potential importance of interviewing multiple people, in order to see how each individual’s background and experience have a unique impact on the way they navigate the discussion, which will in turn affect the choices I will make when creating the final design of my prototype. The process of design heavily relies on the voices of others and that my final product should incorporate a variety of perspectives, something I will keep in mind for future projects.

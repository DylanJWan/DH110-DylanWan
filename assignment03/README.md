# User Research

## Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
This project will help environmentally conscious individuals buy sustainable seafood, by giving them information on specific species’ impact, information if they are MSC or ASC certified, and where to buy those products. 

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity? 
This project will help satisfy its users’ goals toward sustainable living. Sustainable use of ocean products on a large scale improves the quality of Earth’s water, a resource necessary for all living things to survive. Participating in this lifestyle may also improve the user’s self esteem needs, as they will leave feeling confident that they are doing their part to help the environment.


### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The most common current solutions I’ve found that people take when on a mission towards sustainable seafood consumption are to look up sustainable species on websites such as SeafoodWatch, wandering into grocery stores looking for certified sustainable labels, and buying from local markets. However, many do not know where exactly to buy these products nor are they aware of trustworthy sustainability labels.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
There is no site/app containing a synthesis of information about what, how, and where to get sustainable seafood. A lot of the sustainability websites are hard to navigate or do not have enough information to help a person with a plan to buy a specific sustainable seafood product. I aim to streamline the process of finding these products for users.

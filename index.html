         <h4 >Introduction</h4>
    <p> As the Earth’s climate crisis continues to worsen, more people than ever are starting to look into ways to mitigate their individual environmental impact. My project aims to make one of these methods of reducing individual environmental impact, eating sustainably, easier. I chose food sustainability as a topic to focus on as it seemed the most approachable for anyone to implement into their lives. The food group I felt had the most information available was seafood, so my product mainly covers that. 
</p>
        <br>
 <h4 >Design Statement</h4>
    <p> FishFood is the all-in-one place for users to find information about sustainable seafood options, such as fish or fish products, while also providing information on where to buy them.
</p>  <br>
     <p> When researching different websites that gave information about sustainability of specific seafood options, the most up-to-date and comprehensive source was <a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/">seafoodwatch.org</a>. However, this site makes finding sustainable fish very cumbersome, as the hierarchy of information presented is not organized in a way that highlights the nuances of what makes two sustainability ratings pertaining to the same fish potentially different. This website being so easily misunderstood could lead to users purchasing unsustainable seafood while they think they are doing the opposite, which would defeat the purpose of using the site. In terms of finding sustainable seafood products instead of whole fish, there is no single source that organizes a large amount of products by how sustainable they are. My app would overcome these design flaws and combine the information about fish and fish products.

              <h5 class="card-title">Step 1. Heuristic evaluation</h5>
              <p class="card-text">To study competitor sites, I conducted a heuristic analysis on <a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/">seafoodwatch.org</a> and <a href="https://www.msc.org/en-us">msc.org</a>, the latter being an organization that certifies sustainably caught seafood products. The analysis itself consisted  of comparing different aspects of the website to each of Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics. What I found for Seafood Watch was that it most severely failed “recognition rather than recall” and “error prevention,” as it doesn’t give recommended searches for the specific categories it uses, as well as gives no results for slight spelling errors, tedious if you look for niche fishing terms. The MSC website also didn’t do well on “recognition rather than recall” as some links are not easily accessible, and things that look or should be clickable aren’t. After discovering these deficiencies, I was able to formulate solutions which my app could incorporate. </p>

            <p class="card-text">To support my findings from the heuristic analyses, I conducted a pilot usability test for <a href="https://www.msc.org/en-us">msc.org</a>. The test consisted of questions regarding first impressions of the site, then specific tasks that the user had to complete, and finally a reflection about their experience using the site. The tasks I gave were designed to mimic functions that my app would potentially support. In terms of how my user felt about the test, she thought that the site was difficult to use, which made the tasks take longer than she expected overall. After doing this pilot, I was able to gain insight into not only how a user would potentially navigate a website, but also how I could structure a user test.

            <h5 class="card-title">Step 3. Contextual Inquiry</h5>
            <p class="card-text">In order to gain a better understanding of my potential user base, I conducted a contextual inquiry on one such person, a pescatarian who can cook her own meals. For the research process, I first interviewed her in depth about her prior knowledge and reasons for converting to her specific diet. The interview was then followed by activities I designed to give me insight on her thought process behind tasks like finding her preferred method to live more sustainably, finding sustainable fish using any method, and her initial reactions towards well established sustainability indicator logos. From the observed insights I gained, I was able to start thinking about why and how a user would utilize my app.

            <h5 class="card-title">Step 4. UX Storytelling</h5>
            <p class="card-text">To start envisioning what kind of users would have my app, I used UX storytelling. UX storytelling is important to give an audience a more nuanced understanding of my product. By creating realistic and diverse personas, it becomes easier to imagine the variety of ways my product can be used. It's also helpful for me, the UX researcher, to focus on specific users, as it can lead to a deeper understanding of their wants and needs. Being less general in this case can actually result in more universal solutions. For each of my personas I created an empathy map containing how they would feel, act, think, and say, along with a scenario that would lead them to download and use my app to complete a specific task. One of my personas for example is a mom/teacher, who wants to set a good example for her kids by trying to love sustainably. When she wants to cook dinner for her family, she opens my app to find a sustainable fish, and then navigates to where to buy it.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Step 5. Wireframe + Flow</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Based on my user research, I created a low fidelity prototype of what my app would be structured like. Creating wireframes and flows is important because it serves as a simple and quick way to test whether or not the general layout of it will be intuitive for the users. As there is not really much emphasis on the aesthetic or design of the app present on the wireframes, it is only the functionality that is highlighted to be better understood. The tasks that I’ve chosen to work with this prototype are based on the user personas I created for the app, which included a middle aged teacher looking to set a good example for her students and kids by eating sustainably, and an ecologically conscious teenager trying to find out whether or not a food product she wants is sustainable. Both these users’ tasks are straightforward, as my app itself is meant to be viewed quickly for convenience or used spontaneously when the user happens to need specific information related to their potential purchases at a grocery store. In order to test the wireflow I created for my wireframes, I enlisted a potential user to map out what they thought would be the right path to complete the persona’s tasks. I then made modifications based off of their roadblocks or unconventional navigation paths.

          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Step 6. Interface Design</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Using the wireframes I created, I then started to experiment and standardize certain graphic design elements. First starting with a grid, I ended up using 18 columns and 35 rows, which was necessary since my interface had a lot of components. For the typography, I only stuck to one font family, which was Outfit. Its many styles allowed me to create slight variation within different headings and body text while staying visually harmonious. For shapes, I decided to make all the corners of my components rounded with an eight point curve radius. For color, I stuck to muted blues and pastels but made sure there was enough contrast between text and whatever background color it was on. Color contrast is important for accessibility purposes, so I made sure the contrast ratio was above 5. When the design was complete, I conducted a 5-second test observing what a potential user’s first reaction would be. Modifications were then made to clarify any questions or information my test subject was confused with.

            <h5 class="card-title">Step 7. Prototyping</h5>
            <p class="card-text">After designing the interface and modifying it based on the 5-second test results, I finalized the rest of the wireframes and wireflow to create a high fidelity prototype. Some graphic design additions I added included creating a logo and custom button icons in Illustrator. The rest was made in Figma. Cognitive testing was then done on two individuals who gave me their first impressions of the app and completed tasks based on my user personas. In total, my high fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:<br>
1. Logging in <br>
2. Creating a profile <br>
3. Search fish > view sustainability levels <br>
4. Search products > view sustainable products <br>
5. Combining “Search fish” and “Locate store” options <br>
6. Viewing profile if logged in <br>
7. Viewing bookmarks<br><br>
                
In terms of the importance of the high fidelity prototype, it’s a necessary part of the design process helping consumers, or clients visualize what a final product could be. Because it's graphically complete and interactive, it allows me to conduct user testing. With more user testing I can continue to get insights and modify the app if needed.

         <h4 >Reflection</h4>
          <p> Overall I felt that this project was clutch in furthering my understanding of UI/UX research practices. FishFood was my first attempt at going through the entire UX design process, from research, to testing, to prototyping. Unsurprisingly, I was met with many challenges along the way. I thought the hardest steps were the many different user testing stages. I wasn’t expecting being a UX researcher to require so many diverse skills, especially in terms of moderating and interviewing users. There were many times I felt stuck or awkward trying to read my script and keep the conversation going in a direction that would be insightful. Creating the actual content for the tests was also difficult for me, as I felt a lot of abstract thinking was required in order to create questions that would elicit deeper understandings of my user’s thought processes.<br> <br>

What I enjoyed most about this project even with all its challenges would have to be prototyping. Coming into the class I thought this would take up the bulk of the content we covered. However, it turned out to be the synthesis of all the other important steps necessary to getting there. Coming from a more expressive design background, it was a new experience for me to design something so technical. Making sure the fonts were a standardized size, and checking color contrast for accessibility purposes was very fun. I also really enjoyed making my prototype interactive. Thinking about making button interactions consistent and creating a wireflow that connected all the frames in complex ways was out of my comfort zone at first but extremely rewarding. <br> <br>

In the future, some things about my project I would have expanded upon would be the concept more. I intended FishFood to be an app that people would use quickly to find relevant information and then leave. Going through my prototype, I imagined that it would be a more engaging app if it had features like a blog to share recipes or sustainable seafood finds, the ability to follow other users, or an online marketplace. In terms of what I would change about what I have already, I would have liked to test more users outside of the late teen to early twenties demographic, which is what I had access to at the time. I would also have more customizable search options, as well as labeling my buttons that have very specific functions.

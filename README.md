# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation 

### Dylan Wan 
#### User Experience and Design

This project is about the UN sustainable development goal “Life Below Water.” Many people, especially those who don’t live near the coast, have trouble finding ways they can positively impact the ocean. Because of this, I will be focusing on individual consumption of seafood, and how this task can be made easier. In order to do this, I will design a website/app that includes sustainability information about a wide variety of seafood, as well as information about what brands and where to buy them. This would combine what SeafoodWatch and MSC can do on their respective websites. However, in addition to combining them and possibly more relevant information, I’ll be making the interface more intuitive and approachable for consumers.

1. Seafood Watch https://www.seafoodwatch.org/ 
This is a website run by the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California, which provides individuals, businesses, and governments with information about how sustainable different types of seafood are. The website is updated once a month to account for any changes in sustainability.



| 10 Heauristics | Analysis | Severity Rating 0-5 |
|---|---|---|
|1. Visibility of System Status: <br> Design notifies user in a reasonable amount of time when their actions have a consequence | Bad: There is no indication which page on the submenu you just clicked on, just the main item on the menu is highlighted. | 2 |
|2. Match Between System and Real World: <br> Use of simple instead of professional/industry standard terms | Bad: Aquaculture jargon like “purse seines” and “weirs” is necessary to understand how a fish is sourced. Must also be typed into the filter if you wish to search for that specific method used. | 4 |
|3.User Control and Freedom: <br> Easy to undo a user’s action if done by accident | Good: multiple intuitive ways to uncheck a box, such as clicking it again or clicking the x when it shows up | 0 |
| 4.Consistency and Standards:<br> Terms and phrases used perform similar functions as other related websites | Good: Color red to signify bad, yellow okay, and green good | 0 |
| 5.Error Prevention: <br> Design makes mistakes, whether unintentional or intentional difficult | Bad: words have to be typed in correctly for relevant data to populate, there are no search suggestions to help users with words that are spelled similarly | 5 |
| 6.Recognition Rather than Recall:<br> Tools to navigate or use the site are easy to find | Bad: Filter has a search bar for different categories like body of water, but doesn’t give a complete list of what those bodies of water could be, just recommends the most popular searches <br> Bad: Difficult to get to landing page, only possible by clicking the logo, not under any menu <br> Bad:The same menu can appear with slightly different names, making navigation confusing <br> Good: Shows image of the fish to make them more easily recognizable | 5 |
| 7.Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: <br> Shortcuts and customization made available to users who frequent the site often | Good: Filter option available for users who want to add multiple specific variables to their search | 0 |
| 8.Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: <br> Focus on the most important information being available to users | Bad: One type of fish can be listed multiple times if for example they are sourced from different places, however you have to find this difference in the info section which has a very small font<br> Good: Level of sustainability color coded | 4 |
| 9.Help Users with Errors: <br> Error messages are easy to understand and give user a solution | Good: No results for a search are clearly stated in a large bold font instead of the page just being blank. There is also a message that says to try searching with different terms | 0 |
| 10.Help and Documentation: <br> Extra instruction to complete tasks are found when users need it | Good: some words/phrases within the text are clearly underlined and in blue to indicate that it is a link. When pressed a new page with more in depth information pops up. <br> Bad: These links could be listed somewhere else too to make them easier to find | 2 |

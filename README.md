# Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation 

### Dylan Wan 
#### User Experience and Design

This project is about the UN sustainable development goal “Life Below Water.” Many people, especially those who don’t live near the coast, have trouble finding ways they can positively impact the ocean. Because of this, I will be focusing on individual consumption of seafood, and how this task can be made easier. In order to do this, I will design a website/app that includes sustainability information about a wide variety of seafood, as well as information about what brands and where to buy them. This would combine what SeafoodWatch and MSC can do on their respective websites. However, in addition to combining them and possibly more relevant information, I’ll be making the interface more intuitive and approachable for consumers.

# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
#### Dylan Wan 11/2/22

## Project Description 
My project is an app that caters to environmentally conscious individuals looking to eat sustainably, specifically in regards to seafood. Within the app, users will be able to find the most up-to-date information about what fish is sustainable, what seafood products are sustainable, and where to buy said fish and related products. If the user wants to do multiple tasks mentioned above, there will be a feature to combine them to create a roadmap of, for example, finding out whether or not a fish is sustainable, then seeing whether or not that specific fish is available in the user’s area. 

Creating a low fidelity prototype is important for this app because it serves as a simple and quick way to test whether or not the general layout of it will be intuitive for the users. As there is not really much emphasis on the aesthetic or design of the app present, it is only the functionality that is highlighted to be better understood. The tasks that I’ve chosen are based on the user personas I created for the app, which included a middle aged teacher looking to set a good example for her students and kids by eating sustainably, and an ecologically conscious teenager trying to find out whether or not a food product she wants is sustainable. Both these users’ tasks are straightforward, as my app itself is meant to be viewed quickly for convenience or used spontaneously when the user happens to need specific information related to their potential purchases at a grocery store.

## Tasks
1. Sign up, then search for a sustainable fish and where it can be purchased 
2. Login, then search for information regarding whether or not a specific seafood product is sustainably caught

## Reflection + Revision
The wireflow testing process went more smoothly than I could’ve expected. From past experience doing user testing, there were many points where the test user had trouble finding and navigating to buttons to complete certain tasks, taking upwards of 10 minutes on existing websites. However, my test user went through the process of drawing a wireflow to complete the two tasks with ease. This difference in difficulty might be due to the fact that they could see all the potential screens at once, making their decisions less based on guesswork and more about how two wireframes connect. Overall, It didn’t take more than a few minutes for my user to complete each task, and she also didn’t leave many comments as she said it was quite straightforward.

However, there were some questions my test user had going through the process and some unexpected ways my user got through the wireframes. The first comment was in regards to the first task on the fourth frame. She asked if it was necessary to click the icon or search for the fish first. This was surprising as I didn’t intend for these options to be gone through sequentially, but represent multiple ways to search. To make this scenario more clear, I added “or” in between the search bar and the task menu to indicate to the user that searching can be done using one method or the other. Another interesting path I observed her take was again on the fourth frame. I intended the icons underneath the “Combine Tasks” section to be used in the dark gray bar, however she dragged the icons from the “General Tasks” section into the bar instead. Though this wasn’t a mistake, it is a usage I wasn’t intending for, so I will add that as a feature in addition to what I already have, just so users who think of using either version of the icons will be correct. I will make sure to edit the instructions under “Combine Tasks” to include the icons on top. The last comment was mentioned during the second task, which was a question asking why a login was necessary for an app like mine. My reasoning was that having a profile could be more convenient for frequent users, as a profile would save their location and therefore get rid of the extra step of entering it every time when they are a guest user. I also thought it could lead to more customization of the user’s experience, giving them the option to list their favorite fish, and subsequently notifying them if and when it’s sustainable.

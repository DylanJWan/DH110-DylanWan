# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype
#### Dylan Wan 11/2/22

### Project Description 
My project is an app that caters to environmentally conscious individuals looking to eat sustainably, specifically in regards to seafood. Within the app, users will be able to find the most up-to-date information about what fish is sustainable, what seafood products are sustainable, and where to buy said fish and related products. If the user wants to do multiple tasks mentioned above, there will be a feature to combine them to create a roadmap of, for example, finding out whether or not a fish is sustainable, then seeing whether or not that specific fish is available in the user’s area. 

Creating a low fidelity prototype is important for this app because it serves as a simple and quick way to test whether or not the general layout of it will be intuitive for the users. As there is not really much emphasis on the aesthetic or design of the app present, it is only the functionality that is highlighted to be better understood. The tasks that I’ve chosen are based on the user personas I created for the app, which included a middle aged teacher looking to set a good example for her students and kids by eating sustainably, and an ecologically conscious teenager trying to find out whether or not a food product she wants is sustainable. Both these users’ tasks are straightforward, as my app itself is meant to be viewed quickly for convenience or used spontaneously when the user happens to need specific information related to their potential purchases at a grocery store.

### Tasks
1. Search for a sustainable fish and where it can be purchased 
2. Search for information regarding whether or not a specific seafood product is sustainably caught

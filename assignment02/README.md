My test evaluates [msc.org](msc.org) , a website by the Marine Stewardship Council, which is the leading guideline used by fisheries to measure their sustainability satisfaction. Products with a blue MSC label are certified sustainable. User testing is employed to assess measurable qualities in a website that make it usable. The actual test I created contains an intro explaining its details, pre-test questions about the participants prior experience with the website, a number of tasks testing the participant’s ability to navigate the website, three post-test questionnaires such as a SUS questionnaire and post satisfaction card used to describe their experience with the website, and at the end, demographic information. The test was taken in my empty dorm room with Zoom, screen recording and recording the participant. In my first heuristic evaluation of the site, the two heuristics I rated most poorly were “Recognition Rather than Recall” and “Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.” My test therefore evaluated the ease of navigation and content very heavily.

# Assignment 2: Pilot UT

My test evaluates [msc.org](msc.org) , a website by the Marine Stewardship Council, which is the leading guideline used by fisheries to measure their sustainability satisfaction. Products with a blue MSC label are certified sustainable. User testing is employed to assess measurable qualities in a website that make it usable. The actual test I created contains an intro explaining its details, pre-test questions about the participants prior experience with the website, a number of tasks testing the participant’s ability to navigate the website, three post-test questionnaires such as a SUS questionnaire and post satisfaction card used to describe their experience with the website, and at the end, demographic information. The test was taken in my empty dorm room with Zoom, screen recording and recording the participant. In my first heuristic evaluation of the site, the two heuristics I rated most poorly were “Recognition Rather than Recall” and “Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.” My test therefore evaluated the ease of navigation and content very heavily.

### Reflection
The pilot test was harder to conduct than expected. I constantly found myself stumbling on words which probably affected my perceived authority from the participant’s point of view. I think what I need to focus on is not worrying as much on reading the script verbatim, and instead memorize parts or be open to saying things in slightly different ways if it makes my speech flow more naturally. I also had a hard time staying neutral. I could tell that my participant needed more guidance but I made sure to not give any hints unless she completely gave up the task and wanted to move on. In the future I also want to present the questionnaire in a more accessible way. For this pilot I filled out the form on an iPad; I had to pass the iPad back and forth to the participant to let her read the questions which didn’t feel very efficient.

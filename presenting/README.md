# FishFood 

## Dylan Wan, DH110 UI+UX design, Fall 2022

### Design Statement 
My project FishFood is an app that aims to make eating sustainable seafood more convenient and accessible. The app will provide information on the 
sustainability levels of fish, what grocery stores near you currently provide that fish, and information on related fish products.

### Research 
I conducted a hueristic evaluation of [seafoodwatch.org](https://www.seafoodwatch.org/) to understand the current ux problems related to the site. See more about the [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/DylanJWan/DH110-DylanWan/tree/main/assignment01)

I also conducted usability testing with [Marine Stewardship Council](msc.org). The test was taken in my empty dorm room with Zoom, screen recording and recording the participant. In my first heuristic evaluation of the site, the two heuristics I rated most poorly were “Recognition Rather than Recall” and “Aesthetic and Minimalist Design.” My test therefore evaluated the ease of navigation and content very heavily.

# FishFood 

## Dylan Wan, DH110 UI+UX design, Fall 2022

### Design Statement 
My project FishFood is an app that aims to make eating sustainable seafood more convenient and accessible. The app will provide information on the 
sustainability levels of fish, what grocery stores near you currently provide that fish, and information on related fish products.

### Research 
I conducted a hueristic evaluation of seafoodwatch.org to understand the current ux problems related to the site. See more about this at [link ot as 1}

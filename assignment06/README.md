# Assignment 6: Interface Design 
### Dylan Wan 11/09/22

## Description of Project 
My project is an app that aims to make eating sustainable seafood more convenient and accessible. The app will provide information on the sustainability levels of fish, what grocery stores near you currently provide that fish, and information on related fish products. The purpose of creating the interface design for the low fidelity prototype is to fully realize and integrate the function of the app with its visuals. By finalizing the colors, typography, shapes, etc., I have created the app’s style and visual language. Testing the interface with users and testing other aspects like color contrast, I’m more assured of its effectiveness as a product. To design the interface, I started with IPhone 13 Pro frames. Step by step I decided on individual elements like typography and shape until I got the final result. The 5-Second Usability Test was then employed to gauge a user's first impression. All of this was done in Figma.

# Design Process
### Layout Grid & Spacing

### Layout Grid + Spacing Reasoning
The layout grid I went with was 18 columns by 35 rows with a gutter of 5. I had a lot of components in the design, so the grid ended up being small for a mobile interface. I made sure the elements of my design either aligned with the square or the center of gutter intersections to keep it looking harmonious. However, there are a few spots that I couldn’t align perfectly as the content I had was also determining the size and shape of elements.


## Typography

### Typography Reasoning
For Zen Antique, the first font I tested, I felt that the serif made the interface feel too conservative and possibly outdated. These features are incompatible with my goals for the final design to feel fresh and simple. The font also only had a regular mode, not allowing me to make more subtle distinctions in my design with modes such as thin, bold, and black. The other font I didn’t choose was Varela Round. I liked the sans serif and curved edges aspect since it made the interface seem playful and soft. However, like Zen Antique, it only had a regular mode, making the interface seem static when only using the font. I also felt that it made the interface look slightly childish, a characteristic that is incompatible with professional. Outfit, the font I ended up using, is a clean sans serif font with many different modes. Thus, I was able to achieve a simple yet professional look.

## Shapes

### Shapes Reasoning
When experimenting with different shapes, I focused on the corner radii. I found that even slightly adjusting it had a huge impact on the feel of the interface overall. I felt that a radius of 0, resulting in straight edges, made the layout look dated and not very inviting. On the other hand, having a corner radius of 10 or more made the buttons and text look out of place, as they couldn’t neatly fit into such round corners. It looked awkward, and made it look like there was a lot of wasted space, and as a result making it seem like there wasn’t much content. I ended up choosing a corner radius of 8 as I felt that it balanced the modern look a curved edge gave, without ruining any of the spacing of the other elements in the layout.  


## Color Palette

### Color Scheme Reasoning
The color scheme I chose was based around the colors green, yellow, and red. These three were important to choose as because many people already associate them with the meanings of good, okay, and bad, very applicable to how I used them when displaying the sustainability levels of fish. Different shades of blue were also chosen to invoke ideas of the ocean and water, my app being centered around fish. 

## Color Contrast Tests

### Findings/Summary

In the five second test, what stood out to my user was the red, green, and yellow color palette, as well as the image of the fish, which he said felt very realistic and well displayed. Although he didn’t have time to read the contents, he recalled seeing the scientific name of the fish below its image, and his assumptions about the rest of the design were that the red, green, and yellow areas were more information about the fish scientifically or nutritionally. 

When I gave him more time to examine the design afterwards, he understood how the colors represent different levels depending on the region, though not specifically in regards to sustainability. To make this more clear, I will change the header “Search Fish” to “Search Sustainable Fish.” In terms of layout, he thought it was easy to follow and read, and that the colors were appropriate and not too overwhelming. The last thing that he noticed was the other fish at the bottom of the page; making him think the entire interface was likely scrollable, giving information about other fish species broken down in the same red, green, and yellow description boxes, which is what I intended. 

## Interface with Improvement

Added "sustainable" to make the page's purpose more clear after user got confused.

# Assignment 6: Interface Design 
### Dylan Wan 11/09/22

## Description of Project 
My project is an app that aims to make eating sustainable seafood more convenient and accessible. The app will provide information on the sustainability levels of fish, what grocery stores near you currently provide that fish, and information on related fish products. The purpose of creating the interface design for the low fidelity prototype is to fully realize and integrate the function of the app with its visuals. By finalizing the colors, typography, shapes, etc., I have created the app’s style and visual language. Testing the interface with users and testing other aspects like color contrast, I’m more assured of its effectiveness as a product.

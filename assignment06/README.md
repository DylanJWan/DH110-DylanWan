# Assignment 6: Interface Design 
### Dylan Wan 11/09/22

## Description of Project 
My project is an app that aims to make eating sustainable seafood more convenient and accessible. The app will provide information on the sustainability levels of fish, what grocery stores near you currently provide that fish, and information on related fish products. The purpose of creating the interface design for the low fidelity prototype is to fully realize and integrate the function of the app with its visuals. By finalizing the colors, typography, shapes, etc., I have created the app’s style and visual language. Testing the interface with users and testing other aspects like color contrast, I’m more assured of its effectiveness as a product.

## Design Process
### Layout Grid & Spacing

### Layout Grid + Spacing Reasoning
The layout grid I went with was 18 columns by 35 rows with a gutter of 5. I had a lot of components in the design, so the grid ended up being small for a mobile interface. I made sure the elements of my design either aligned with the square or the center of gutter intersections to keep it looking harmonious. However, there are a few spots that I couldn’t align perfectly as the content I had was also determining the size and shape of elements.


### Typography

### Findings/Summary
In the five second test, what stood out to my user was the red, green, and yellow color palette, as well as the image of the fish, which he said felt very realistic and well displayed. Although he didn’t have time to read the contents, he recalled seeing the scientific name of the fish below its image, and his assumptions about the rest of the design were that the red, green, and yellow areas were more information about the fish scientifically or nutritionally. 

When I gave him more time to examine the design afterwards, he understood how the colors represent different levels depending on the region, though not specifically in regards to sustainability. To make this more clear, I will change the header “Search Fish” to “Search Sustainable Fish.” In terms of layout, he thought it was easy to follow and read, and that the colors were appropriate and not too overwhelming. The last thing that he noticed was the other fish at the bottom of the page; making him think the entire interface was likely scrollable, giving information about other fish species broken down in the same red, green, and yellow description boxes, which is what I intended.

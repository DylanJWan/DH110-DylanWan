# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
## Dylan Wan | 11/16/22
### Project and Purpose 
My app FishFood aims to help make eating sustainably easy, specifically in regards to seafood consumption. In order to do that, FishFood is the all-in-one place for users to find information about sustainable seafood options, whether that be fish or fish products, and information on where to buy them. The high fidelity prototype I created for the app is a necessary part of its development process as it helps to visualize what a final product could be. Not only is it graphically complete, it is also interactive. This is important because it allows me to conduct user testing, giving me the most insight I can get on the app. In order to create the hifi prototype, I used Figma to create the wireframes, along with plugins to illustrate the wireflow, provide icons, check color contrast, as well as making text on an arc. Additional icons and the logo were created by me in Adobe Illustrator.

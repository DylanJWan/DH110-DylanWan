## Purpose of UX Storytelling 
UX storytelling is important to give an audience a more nuanced understanding of my product. By creating realistic and diverse personas, they can better imagine the variety of ways my product can be used. It's also helpful for me, the UX researcher, to focus on specific users, as it can lead to a deeper understanding of their wants and needs. Being less general in this case can actually result in more universal solutions.

## Scenarios and Journey Maps
### Sarah's Scenario
#### Why?
Sarah tries her best to make sure her nearly 30 students at Washington Irving High succeed academically and outside of school. The same can be said for her two young children, who will also be going to high school in a few years. Part of the reason she chose to become a teacher was because she believes that children are the future and can implement changes to make the world a better place. However, the potential burdens of climate change her students and children will have to face have been weighing on her mind. Just two years ago, her students participated in a nationwide walkout for climate change, inspired by the young climate activist Greta Thunberg. Ever since that day, Sarah has tried to promote sustainable living. Admittedly though, she is also new to this. With the daily stresses of teaching and being a mother, she knew she wouldn’t have time to participate in beach cleanups every weekend. The solution she thought worked best for her was buying sustainable food, “but where do I start?” she thought to herself. As an avid lover of seafood, she downloads an app giving her the most up-to-date information on sustainable seafood and where to purchase it. 
#### How?
Sarah gets into the app and is brought to a home page with a search bar and options such as “find out what is currently the most sustainable fish,” “find sustainable fish near you,” and many more. She chooses “find sustainable fish near you” as she wants to make fish tacos for her family since they all love seafood. In the app, she is led to a survey asking what her location is; there are options to make such information as specific as she wants. She inputs her home location and finds sustainable fish products with information about the grocery stores that have them in stock. She now makes this a routine whenever she feels like cooking seafood.

## Purpose of UX Storytelling 
UX storytelling is important to give an audience a more nuanced understanding of my product. By creating realistic and diverse personas, they can better imagine the variety of ways my product can be used. It's also helpful for me, the UX researcher, to focus on specific users, as it can lead to a deeper understanding of their wants and needs. Being less general in this case can actually result in more universal solutions.
